Perfect! The program now:
  1. Tokenizes the string using BPE
  2. Displays the colorized tokens
  3. Shows the total token count
  4. Prints a formatted table with model names, calculated prompt costs, and price per million tokens

  The code is structured to make it easy to add new models - just add them to the models array with their name
  and price per million tokens. The table automatically calculates the cost based on the token count and
  formats it appropriately.
